# EVE Production Calculator WordPress Shortcode

Adds a shortcode [eve_production_calculator] which allows users to see the build requirements for any blueprint in EVE Online.

**Notes:**
Currently only lists the base input materials as if you "show info" on the blueprint in-game.
This is going to be a long-term project for me to work on here and there, unlike the other shortcodes I've spent some time on recently.

**Planned features:**
- Structure input, including automatic ME and TE calculations
- Duration, including all relevent skills, implants, and (above) structure calculations
- Desired QTY
- Multiple Inputs for different item types

**Stretch Goals (Not sure if I can manage this)**
- Optimal Ores to Mine/Buy for reprocessing
- - Various options, such as ISK efficient (minimal amount of ISK invested after waste minerals are sold off), or mineral efficient (minimal amount of waste product)
